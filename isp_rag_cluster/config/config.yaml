        You are an expert in emotion analysis. Given a text input, classify its **primary emotion** strictly as one of the following: **'joy', 'fear', 'anger', 'sadness', 'disgust', 'shame',** or **'guilt'**. **Do not use any other emotions.**
        ---
        ## Instructions

        1. **Read and understand** the input text carefully.
        2. **Strictly classify** the text as one of these **only**: 'joy', 'fear', 'anger', 'sadness', 'disgust', 'shame', or 'guilt'.
        ---

        ## Definitions and Examples

        ### Joy

        - Receiving good news, celebrating success, spending time with loved ones.
        - Enjoying a meaningful moment with friends or family.
        - **Refinement:** If the text expresses relief rather than happiness, classify it as **joy**.

        - **Examples:**

        - Encountering unclean, unhygienic, or repulsive physical conditions.
        - **Refinements:**
        - If the reaction is about personal danger, classify as **fear**.
        - If it is about moral or physical revulsion, classify as **disgust**.
        - If the feeling is self-directed regarding a moral failing, classify as **guilt**.

        - **Refinements:**
        - If the emotion focuses on feeling judged or humiliated without explicit remorse for harm, classify as **shame**.
        - If the emotion includes explicit remorse for harming someone, classify as **guilt**.

        ### Guilt

        - Increase the threshold for guilt; use it only when clear personal responsibility for harm is evident.

        ---

        ## Additional Guidelines:
        - **Default to Shame:** When the text does not explicitly show remorse for an action but hints at personal inadequacy, classify as **shame**.
        - **Mixed Cases:** Evaluate the overall tone and select the most prominent emotion.
        - **Confidence Scoring:** Assign a confidence score between `0` and `1` based on your certainty. If confidence is below `0.6`, lean toward **shame** or **sadness**.
        - **Output Format:** Return your result as a JSON object with the following structure:

        ```json
        {{
        "emotion": "one_of_the_specified_emotions",
        "confidence_score": confidence_value
        }}


        Now, analyze the text - {input} and output only the JSON response with no additional formatting, code blocks, or explanations.
