    ## Detailed Guidelines for Distinguishing Shame, Guilt, and Disgust:
    Below are emotions that are particularly difficult to distinguish. It is important to distinguish between these emotions.

    1. Shame:
      - Definition: Shame is a self-conscious emotion arising from a perception of personal inadequacy or failure, often experienced when one feels exposed to social judgment or humiliation. It emphasizes a negative evaluation of the self.
      - Examples:
        - "Feeling deeply embarrassed after a public mistake."
        - "Experiencing a sense of worthlessness when criticized by peers."
      - Key Indicators:
        - Focus on social evaluation and self-worth.
        - Emphasis on internal feelings of inadequacy rather than direct remorse for a specific harmful action.

    2. Guilt:
      - Definition: Guilt is an emotion that occurs when an individual recognizes that their actions have harmed someone else or violated moral standards. It is linked to a sense of responsibility and a desire to make amends.
      - Examples:
        - "Feeling remorse after hurting a friend's feelings."
        - "Experiencing regret after realizing one's mistake caused harm."
      - Key Indicators:
        - Direct association with specific actions that caused harm.
        - Accompanied by a willingness to apologize or take corrective action.
        - Focus on the behavior rather than on personal inadequacy.

    3. Disgust:
      - Definition: Disgust is a strong, aversive emotion characterized by revulsion or repulsion toward something offensive, unclean, or morally objectionable. It primarily serves as a mechanism to avoid potential contamination or unethical behavior.
      - Examples:
        - "Feeling physically nauseated when encountering unhygienic conditions."
        - "Experiencing revulsion upon hearing about unethical actions."
      - Key Indicators:
        - Emphasis on an immediate aversive reaction.
        - Less about self-reflection and more about rejecting or avoiding the stimulus.
        - Often accompanied by physical expressions such as wrinkling the nose or turning away.

    - Only classify as **guilt** if there is explicit harm or clear wrongdoing causing remorse.
    - If there is no explicit harm mentioned, default to **shame**.
    - Increase the threshold for guilt; use it only when clear personal responsibility for harm is evident.

    ---

    ## Additional Guidelines:
    - **Default to Shame:** When the text does not explicitly show remorse for an action but hints at personal inadequacy, classify as **shame**.
    - **Mixed Cases:** Evaluate the overall tone and select the most prominent emotion.
    - **Confidence Scoring:** Assign a confidence score between `0` and `1` based on your certainty. If confidence is below `0.6`, lean toward **shame** or **sadness**.
    - **Output Format:** Return your result as a JSON object with the following structure:

    ```json
    {
      "emotion": "one_of_the_specified_emotions",
      "confidence_score": confidence_value,
      "explanation": "brief_explanation"
    }
    ```

    Now, analyze the text, and output only the JSON response with no additional formatting, code blocks, or explanations.
