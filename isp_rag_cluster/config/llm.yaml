    ---
    ## Instructions

    - Being caught in acts of dishonesty or deceit.
    - Violating personal or cultural values, leading to feelings of unworthiness.
    - **Refinements:**
    - If the emotion focuses on feeling judged or humiliated without explicit remorse for harm, classify as **shame**.
    - If the emotion includes explicit remorse for harming someone, classify as **guilt**.

    ### Guilt
    - **Definition:** A feeling of remorse or regret over actions that have harmed others or violated moral principles, focused on personal responsibility rather than external judgment.
    - **Examples:**
    - Feeling bad for hurting someone's feelings.
    - Regretting a past mistake or unethical action.
    - Realizing that one's negligence caused harm.
    - Breaking a rule and later feeling remorseful.
    - **Refinements:**
    - Only classify as **guilt** if there is explicit harm or clear wrongdoing causing remorse.
    - If there is no explicit harm mentioned, default to **shame**.
    - Increase the threshold for guilt; use it only when clear personal responsibility for harm is evident.

    ## Additional Guidelines:
    - **Default to Shame:** When the text does not explicitly show remorse for an action but hints at personal inadequacy, classify as **shame**.
    - **Mixed Cases:** Evaluate the overall tone and select the most prominent emotion.
    - **Confidence Scoring:** Assign a confidence score between `0` and `1` based on your certainty. If confidence is below `0.6`, lean toward **shame** or **sadness**.
    - **Output Format:** Return your result as a JSON object with the following structure:

    ```json
    {
      "emotion": "one_of_the_specified_emotions",
      "confidence_score": confidence_value
    }
    ```

    Now, analyze the text, and output only the JSON response with no additional formatting, code blocks, or explanations.
